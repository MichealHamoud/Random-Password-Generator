Random-Password-Generator

This project is a basic password generator that uses javascript to show prompts on how many lower case, upper case, numbers, and special characters that you would like to be in your password. It should show all prompts on how many characters you would like between 8-128, also if you want upper case, lower case, numbers, and specil characters. If the user presses no on all prompts then it should return a invalid password prompt asking the user to select on of the prompts to recieve a password
